=============

Suggestions:

- JHED authentication
- Editor groups, so you can edit anyone's content inside of your editor group.
	- Note: Can we create a "role" for each group and allow them to edit any in that role?
- Style guidelines? Donde?

- "What should we submit?" : where are the guidelines?
	- How and who decides what is worth entering?
	- How do the contributors avoid wasted and duplicate effort?

	- My note: what would these guidelines look like?
	- We need a full explanation in writing of what things link out, what stays in, what the criteria are, why, etc.

	- How do contributors add images, galleries, captions, video?


- Contracts with freelance writers, how do they interact with stories being published to the Hub.

- Can we tag images as "not for reuse" so that things like illustrations can be added to a story without being reused?

- Should "summary" fall back to "subheadline" if it exists, then fall back to "first x number of words" second?

=== SOURCE INFO
- Source Publication: should be dropdown
- Source Publication Date: sometimes this is just a "Fall 2012"
- "From outside of JHU?" -> needs new language
- Should we check for broken links in the source pub url field over time? (I don't know that this is necessary)

=== TOPICS
- Need a new topic for Econ, Social Sciences, Policy, Business, Govt/Politics, International(SAIS)
	- Politics and Society?

=== Images

- How can you add "search" to the media manager?
- How can you edit fields on upload of an image?
